# :recycle: Ecoleta React-Native Application (Mobile)

## :information_source: About

This is the code for the mobile app created in the **Next Level Week** from **Rocketseat**. For information about complete application, view the `README.md` in root of the repository.

## :flags: Future

Some features, that i want to add to this app was not in this version and, in this section, i decided to list each of this features for a mental helper for next changes in this code.

### Map initialization position

In the future, i want to initialize the map in the selected state and city and not in the phone location. This is because not make sense for a people locating a point in other city and the map visualization initialize in your city.

### Create Point

Add support to create point in the mobile application. This is planed to the future.
